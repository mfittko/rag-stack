# Vision

raged is a multi-agent memory hub: a shared retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) layer with enrichment and entity relationship capabilities.

## Why

AI agents work best with relevant context, but stuffing entire knowledge bases into a model's context window is wasteful and expensive. raged keeps the heavy retrieval work outside the model loop: ingest once, query many times, return only what's relevant.

Vector search alone finds *semantically similar* content. But real knowledge has structure — docs reference code, emails discuss designs, repos depend on libraries. raged tracks these relationships to enrich retrieval beyond pure similarity.

| Query type | Vector DB | + Graph DB |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| "Find code about auth" | Semantic match | Same |
| "What docs reference this function?" | Can't | Follow edges |
| "Show the email thread behind this design" | Can't | Traverse relationships |
| "What depends on this library?" | Can't | Dependency graph |
| "Find auth code AND everything connected to it" | Partial | Hybrid: similarity + graph neighbors |

## Roadmap

### v0.5 — MVP (completed)

What exists:

- HTTP API: `/ingest` and `/query` endpoints — content-agnostic, accepts any text
- CLI indexer: bulk-index Git repos (clone, chunk, ingest via API)
- Bearer token authentication
- Docker Compose for local development
- Helm chart for Kubernetes deployment
- In-cluster indexing Job
- Agent integrations: Claude Code skill, OpenClaw AgentSkill

### v1.0 — Enrichment & Relationship Layer ✅ (completed)

**Metadata extraction pipeline:**
- ✅ **Tiered extraction:** tier-1 (sync, heuristic/AST/EXIF) → tier-2 (async, spaCy NLP) → tier-3 (async, LLM)
- ✅ **8 document types:** code, Slack, email, meeting notes, images, PDFs, articles, text
- ✅ **Auto-detection:** Document type inference from file extension and content
- ✅ **Pluggable LLM adapter:** Ollama (local), Anthropic, OpenAI with smart model routing
- ✅ **Async enrichment worker** in Python with Postgres task queue
- ✅ **Retry logic:** Exponential backoff with dead-letter queue for failed tasks
- ✅ **Status tracking:** Per-document enrichment status via `/enrichment/status/:baseId`

**Relationship layer:**
- ✅ **Postgres-backed storage:** Entity and relationship storage with indexed lookups
- ✅ **Entity extraction:** NER via spaCy (tier-2) and LLM-based extraction (tier-3)
- ✅ **Relationship extraction:** Automatic discovery of entity relationships
- ⚠️ **Graph expansion transition:** `graphExpand` query expansion is currently available but experimental and will transition to Apache AGE-backed graph queries; API details may change
- ⚠️ **Graph API transition:** Graph lookup endpoints are being aligned with Apache AGE on Postgres (https://age.apache.org/) and may be feature-gated in some deployments
- ✅ **Document linking:** Track which documents mention which entities

**API endpoints:**
- ✅ `GET /enrichment/status/:baseId` — Check enrichment status for a document
- ✅ `GET /enrichment/stats` — System-wide enrichment statistics
- ✅ `POST /enrichment/enqueue` — Manually trigger enrichment tasks
- ✅ `GET /graph/entity/:name` — Query entity details and connections

**CLI enhancements:**
- ✅ `raged ingest` — Ingest arbitrary files (PDFs, images, Slack exports)
- ✅ `raged enrich` — Trigger and monitor enrichment with `--force` and `--stats` flags
- ✅ `raged graph` — Query relationship entities (transitioning)
- ✅ `--no-enrich` / `--doc-type` flags on ingest commands (enrichment is on by default when enabled server-side)

**Infrastructure:**
- ✅ Docker Compose profiles: `--profile enrichment` for full stack (Postgres, worker)
- ✅ Helm chart: all enrichment resources gated on `enrichment.enabled`
- ✅ Backwards-compatible: existing API/CLI behavior unchanged when enrichment disabled
- ✅ Environment-driven configuration: `ENRICHMENT_ENABLED`, `POSTGRES_URL`

### v2.0 — Production Hardening + Multi-Agent Hub (planned)

**Production hardening:**
- **Testing:** Comprehensive unit and integration test coverage
- **Input validation:** JSON Schema on all API routes (in progress)
- **Multiple embedding providers:** Adapter pattern — swap Ollama for OpenAI, Cohere, or local alternatives
- **Alternative storage backends:** Postgres today, support for Pinecone/Weaviate/Qdrant via adapters
- **Rate limiting and request throttling**
- **Structured logging and health checks** (beyond `/healthz`)
- **API versioning** (`/v1/ingest`, `/v1/query`)

**Multi-agent hub:**
- **Multi-tenancy:** Isolated collections per team/project with scoped tokens
- **Agent authentication:** Per-agent API keys with fine-grained permissions
- **Cross-collection search:** Federated queries across multiple collections
- **Real-time sync:** Webhook-triggered re-indexing when content sources change
- **Agent collaboration:** Shared memory spaces where multiple agents contribute and query
- **Observability:** Distributed tracing, query analytics, embedding cache hit rates
- **SDK/client libraries:** TypeScript, Python, Go clients (beyond CLI)

## Principles

- **Stateless API, stateful storage.** The API process holds no state. Scale it horizontally.
- **Local-first.** Docker Compose must always work. Cloud deployment is optional.
- **Agent-agnostic.** Not tied to any single agent. Claude Code, OpenClaw, or any agent that can call HTTP or shell out to a CLI can use raged.
- **Content-agnostic.** Not just for code. Any text content — docs, articles, emails, transcripts, PDFs, images — is a first-class citizen.
- **Minimal dependencies.** Every dependency must justify its existence.
- **Security by default.** Auth is optional locally, mandatory in production.
